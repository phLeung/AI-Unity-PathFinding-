Open up the Build folder and run the "AI Project Pathfinding.exe"
Once the program has started just watch the agent go to all the find a path to each 'collectable' object. 
When the agent has been to all the objects a single cycle is complete.
Then all the 'collectable' objects are respawned and the agent will do the same all over again.
This will repeat 3 times and the data for the agents total distance, total nodes traveled, and the total time are logged.
When all 3 cycles are complete it will display the information on the left side of the screen.

Color Codes:
-Agent is blue
-Collectables are red

More Info:
-For more information on whats going on read the source code and the comments within.

Side Note:
Breadth first search wont work for some reason. Multiple implementations have been tried but all results
in OutOfMemoryException. Many tweaks have been made trying to fix this problem.
The code for BFS is still in the PathFinding.cs class but it is never used or the program will cras
Originally the data from A* would be compared to the data of BFS.
